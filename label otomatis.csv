"What's worse about the tweets of the conflict between Israel and Palestine in Indonesia is that it brings it into the realm of the rioting camps in Indonesia, there is a reason that is more damaged than that yet in Indonesia."
"In difficult conditions such as concentration camps, Israel's behavior retaliates, even though the impact on the settlements of the colonized residents is still reasonable. I am happy for Hamas to advance with rockets, the deterrent effect is that Palestine can be injured to the heart of Israel"
People are starting to appear pretentiously defending Israel and the Israel vs Palestine campaign is not a religious conflict for people who defend Palestine on a wrong religious basis
nothing worse than spit that speaks arabic but zionist heart he quipped Arabs themselves who are wrong in Hamas and palestine and silence with tyrannical zionist jews I also met someone like this who shouted independence but kept quiet

"We support the struggle of the Palestinian people but we don't need to support the radical Hamas, you idiot. You hear, the attack is focused on Gaza and that is indeed under the Hamas administration and Hamas is indeed one of the militant groups with weapons."
"It's true that this is the Hamas conflict or the Palestine vs Israel conflict. Palestine is not only Gaza, the Palestinian people also work in Israel for the Israeli people. They also condemn the act of ordering in Palestine. Muslims living together with non-Muslims are strange."
"Israel-Palestine conflict in the eyes of the average or many Muslims and the media is the same analogy as Jakarta vs Papua in the eyes of the average human rights activist and the Israeli media or Jakarta just fart against Palestine or Papua then you will get great coverage, Mas Toto"

"But if you don't like Hamas, you'll definitely say you don't support Palestine, you support Israel, even though you've just seen an example now that Hamas is attacking Israel in vain because of the Iron Dome."
"The wrong point of view of Muslims themselves, who first became Jews and Christians, is like a group whose enemies are based on the Koran, the political conflict in Israel, Palestine, then becomes a conflict."
"It's too much to worship Hamas, if Allah Azza wa Jalla doesn't belong to any role in protecting Palestine, defending Palestine can only be done with effort, even though if you want to dismantle Hamas, it's only pretending to be the enemy of the Jews and defending Palestine."
"For some reason, I saw that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was right as an attempt to prevent it from becoming the apocalypse because the prediction of the apocalypse had arrived, the conflict was over and what happened"
"It's because he likes to use Palestinian attributes, so every Palestinian issue people focus on religious conflict"
"Israel vs Hamas orders, I join you, purely a political conflict, so far the news has turned into a religious conflict as usual. What conflict is the biggest victim, Israel, Palestine?"
"Hamas is only looking for economic profit from the conflict they created, while Israel is helping Palestine sit down with the covid vaccine, so what are we doing with the Israeli Hamas conflict?"
"The conflict can be said to be the same if the cause is the same, but the Sampit case is different from the Poso case, especially the Palestine vs Israel case, we once expelled FPI during a direct conflict because they wanted to ride with the issue of religious sentiment."
"Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians at all, they control Gaza with propaganda and pressure"

"Israeli Jews are confused now that they are not only at war with Hamas, Palestine, but also war with the Lebanese Jordanian people, maybe Egypt will follow."
"The Hamas terrorist war with Israel, the Palestinian people is just a shield for Hamas' life"
"You really care about and care about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, your neighbors are having a hard time and are hungry, you just don't care about those who are far away and those who are close don't care"
"I really support the Palestinian people but please guys, don't be stupid, don't swallow all the news if you don't know what the Israel vs Palestine conflict is, I'm just joining the Zionist political conflict Israel vs Hamas, not between religions, Judaism vs Islam, must be smart"
"Maybe a corrupt country can do that, colonize, let us know that Hamas is corrupt and the Palestinian command is incompetent. What's the right relationship with colonizing and attacking Israel on Palestine"
"Hamas thinks that maintaining a crazy conflict, the Palestinians attack it while praying Tarawih quietly, that's wrong, Hamas thinks this time"
x Supporting Hamas is not a Palestinian state but pretending to support Palestine only with costumes
"The short axes who eat the narrative will be confused by the fact that there are Hamas who maintain war and fortunately there are those who are even more confused by the fact that there are orthodox Jews who actually support the Palestinians, the bad guys and the good guys in both."
"Or also the knot that if you have sympathy for the Palestinian condition, it's the same as supporting Hamas. This is really weird too"

"I agree with this mother, I think it's clear that she stands up for the Palestinian people, if from the costumes and narrative she supports the Palestine Liberation Organization, try to find one that supports the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, the narrative is definitely different."
"That's not the logic of thinking, bro, dehumanizing Israel against Palestine is for a defense mechanism for the Palestinian people, which is marked by the formation of several organizations against one of Hamas, all Palestinians, the right to self-defense because of colonialism."
"Self-defense is necessary, but what Hamas is doing is bombing Israel with rockets and then protecting it behind civilian houses rather than making a basement above a Palestinian residence, it's the same as giving Israel time to attack Palestine"
"if you help stop the war, it might take a long time to run out of funds and eventually force a ceasefire"
"The suffering of the Palestinian people has led to the issue of the Hamas vs. Zionist conflict, so many understand that the Palestinians are victims and are stupid. Not one of them leads or knows that they live in Gaza. You are stupid."
"I'll repeat that the mechanism against Hamas is the same as before against the oppression of the system. I'll ask you, what is your theory in the problem of Hamas, that Hamas is Palestinians, what theory do you hold, humans, explain your theoretical perspective."
Diplomacy for Palestine and Israel is like hoping for an apple that can be picked from a starfruit tree

"there are so many analyzes that say that Hamas really doesn't care about the safety of the Palestinian people, they know very well that the rockets sent to Israel will not be of much use, but in fact they send too"
"the issue of religious conflict to brutally close Israel in the evil occupation of apartheid, fight for Islam, be patient, don't provoke it with suicide bombings, this method is not smart, it will make Islam bad name and end the issue of Palestine's transfer to Israel"
"just like saudi arabia which went bankrupt the economic system in yemen and today asks for a ceasefire and the end of the israel war too, saudi arabia is still in the region because it belongs to history but zionists only contain migrants and are stateless"
"If the Palestinian conflict with Israel is normal, PKS immediately raises donations as well as ex-FPI. Ex-HTI is always fussy about religion, even though it's only a political issue."
"Hopefully the two countries can live in peace and harmony, hopefully Palestine and Israel can both be independent because in accordance with the constitution that Indonesia is independent"
"Even the people of Israel themselves are asking for a ceasefire, hopefully it will end soon"
China where the polo people kneel the soul of the Zionists who serve China and Israel laknatulloh
"Palestinians believe that Israel said that calling for a ceasefire has been destroyed, right? Gaza is a subtle Israeli war tactic to die. Gaza's economy will all wake up and be damaged. If he continues, Israel will surely turn to ashes."
"the israel vs palestine conflict, the financial benefits of the Hamas group"
support Palestine but not with Hamas it must be the fruit of an easy-to-understand attitude
I like Palestine and Israel and Hamas I don't like it
"Do you know that Hamas is because of the conflict between Palestine and Israel, I personally prefer PFLP or Fatah, even though they are communists and liberals, but it's still far better to say that the demonstration was a provocation from the first clash but"
"It is Hamas that always causes trouble. Hamas wants peace with Israel, but the condition is that all Jews are killed and Israel has to leave Jerusalem. This is not a win-win solution."
for khaled mashal israel vs palestine conflict means money
"Yes, that's why UN wants to be in the middle of this problem, proposes a solution, namely Palestine and Israel but Fatah wants it but Hamas refuses and Hamas wants death to all"
"Israel knows very well that Palestine has protested directly against Al Aqsa, rioting the worshipers after that, and then Gaza has attacked, under the pretext of Hamas, for twenty years, but yes, it's still surprising."
Koplo people in this country are frying the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
"It's an old hoax, people don't care, it's even more true that the issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict is indeed the one who takes care of it"
"there's a lot of people talking about Palestine and Israel and the curses that defend it, uh, end up making a donation, so it's not a donation"
"Israel is starting to worry about stocks of iron dome tips, while rockets from Hamas continue to go crazy, the West is starting to force a ceasefire"
"don't want to stop, their true nature is hypocrisy"
"After diving through the post, the conflict between Palestine and Israel, both the pros and cons, even touched the issue of Islamic history that we rarely know about ourselves."
"Yes, it's stupid of you to say thank God when the missile was able to hit Israel"
give support not only for the benefit of the party but we are like people who believe in God
no grounds for a ceasefire
"Palestine, even though it has received positive world sentiment from seizing land on the west bank yesterday, had to let PLA go forward but was instead damaged by Hamas by pulling the focus back to the Gaza line conflict by bombing each other with Israel."
"Don't stop fighting, wait for Israel to powder first, it's good"
"The Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the grassroots may not be based on religion and race, many people say that but I believe these two primordial identities are the big basis in the conflict."
"Fatah will probably cooperate with Hamas on Israel, this merger is rarely sold in Palestine, so the fight for Palestine's allies is getting stronger and has joined the Jordanian people, Syria, Iraq and Luban, who will continue with Palestine."
I understand more and more that Hamas is a terror organization in Saudi Arabia because they sell the suffering of the Palestinian people by using religion
"In Palestine, the Hamas Party in Indonesia has the same affiliation as the Muslim Brotherhood, they love the caliphate, even if by means of terror"
"Fatah may join hands with Hamas against a rare combination in Palestine, so the fight for Palestine's allies is getting stronger. The Jordanians, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon also want to join the fight against SavePalestine Israel."
"Hamas is no different from terrorists who protect behind religion and protect the Palestinian people for the sake of the ambitions of the Palestinian people. Radical victims don't want peace, but the feeling of being oppressed is the same as Kadrun, how can Palestinians get sympathy from the world?"
"there is nothing wrong with israel or palestine it is the fault of the rioters that Hamas has become the victim of palestine for their own sake, unfortunately the majority of Muslims are blinded by the media that keeps framing wrongly against israel"
"Palestine is the name of the region in terms of ethnicity and religion, while the state of Israel is a country that the settlers of the colony see as Zionists claim that the pretext of religion that expelled tribes in Palestine has nothing to do with Israel's descent."
Hamas is one of the causes of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
"And how is it that Israel will win, the people will kill Palestine, there will be less Israel belongs to America and China, whoever attacks Israel with weapons will actually hurt Muslims. Diplomacy is a good way, but it's tutu"
"you live in Indonesia, do you know about the problems of Palestine and Israel, of course, you know what is right and wrong, it's clear that my prediction is just a trap for you."
only so the Muslim community in Indonesia they support Hamas but hate the shia who help Iran material to Palestine which Turkey praises with its erdogan try reading the news don't just read family wags don't be ashamed that's how you praise Iran Palestineunderattack
"While the Hamas leadership enjoys a luxurious life, the Palestinian people are victims of the Hamas bombing and Israel, but the planting of the seeds is always a religious issue."
because what the world needs is an opinion that Palestine is independent with Jerusalem as its capital
there are many people who are misunderstood about the conflict between Palestine and Israel
"Indonesia doesn't have diplomatic relations with Israel, it's been a long time without pressuring the Arab countries to make Palestine independent."
"the point of all this is that until the end of the apocalypse, Israel and Palestine will not be at peace, only Allah swt knows when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will end in this world."
"Palestine vs Israel conflict is not a religious war in our country, this is an issue where is the boiling point of Islam vs Judaism"
"remember reading Fadel more about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but if you look at it from the human side and try to remember history and what was written in the Koran, yes, let's just be quiet."
"If Israel has been at peace from the first, it's been over, this is a conflict, Israel wants Palestine to be annihilated and can't stop them."
"Moderates in this country must be at the forefront of opposing Israel, because the state of Israel is the basic form of the race and religion of Judaism. Because defending Palestine is lonely, there are no moderates, so defending Palestine is actually hijacked by groups with the exact same character as Israel."
"To be honest, I'm not quite confused about the conflict that has occurred in Palestine, the public perception that supports it can be the same as massively spreading this information, sir, as was the case with Muhammadiyah figures, etc."
By not defending Palestine against the Zionist occupation of Israel you are not only not funny but disgusted
"Palestine vs Israel conflict is indeed an old conflict, the new one is today in Indonesia some people are actually on the side of Israel"
"who attacked Israel or Palestine first, please help, why is everyone being stupid by asking this question, Israel has attacked first since last year"
"foreign policy, Indonesia's command from the beginning has supported Palestine, Indonesia, is very hostile towards Israel and refuses to establish relations with Israel. Program follow-up"
"Did you read my reply, didn't Israel first refuse the ceasefire that Egypt suggested, if you want to lick Israel, don't bear it"
"Israel vs Palestine conflict is just over territory, not a religious war, not related to Israel's religion, support AS"
Indonesia's commanding stance is also firm and clear in its stance on the Palestine and Israel crisis
"If I just want peace instead of attacking, so many victims will be afraid of the conflict between Palestine vs Israel, I hope it ends soon, the end of peace"
"I agree, sir, I've heard a lot about what the Israeli command saw that they don't want to live with Palestine, it's just that I don't know if that's the whole way to do it or not."
Israel's jews zionists do not work with fleas and denounces Palestine needs real help that can free Palestine from the zionist planes
"hmmm, isn't it like that, the story of general sudirman, in fact, Sukarno's opponent, who wanted a ceasefire, was the forerunner of the enemy in the army, with Sukarno, who ended up taking over orders by Suharto, reading Salim's book, said"
"Shia Rafidhah is free from Palestine reliably. Hamas means that Hamas works for the importance of Imam, Shia Rafidhah, not because of Allah ta'ala and it is important that Islam does not deceive those who say this is for the sake of Islam."
"Yes, Hamas is wrong because using human shields and Israel are barbaric, already thinking about it, there is no need for binary mail, how can Israel's ruthless curses work but also Hamas' reckless curses can do it"
Don't Israel Sit Where Palestine Lives Don't Enter Palestine
"Look, the West lobbied the West to force a ceasefire, beat them up until they left Palestine"
The Palestinian conflict is still continuing because there is a terror organization that wants to rule there by selling the suffering of the people and the religion of Islam
"It's scary that people like him are good at narrating stories about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because people's opinions are influenced by many people, so they doubt whether they want to support Palestine or not."
"I am Indonesian, they hate Hamas in Indonesia, they are traitors and divide them from the Jews and Israel and their actions are very shameful, like creatures, feel like humans."
Hamas stops attacking and Israel continues to build illegal settlements on Palestinian land and continue to claim it as their own
"It's busy, Hamas is the same as Israel. Hamas is the Palestinian movement from the Sunni and nationalist Islamic groups, which is about sitting Israel's Zionists in Palestine, fighting with colonialism is a different matter"
"The beginning of the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was when a cold and hungry poor person knocked on your house, begging for food and protection, and you have helped you to be killed."
"Palestine vs Israel bullshit can be negotiated with diplomatic channels, decades of diplomatic campaigning, still conflict continues Israelterrorist Israelterrorist"
"Yes, indeed, the conflict in Palestine is not a religious conflict. It is true who says which religion Palestine is also not Muslim, but in this Palestinian conflict, the victim is Muslim, right?"
"Israel has been expelling and killing the Palestinian people for a long time, then Hamas was born as an opponent when it became a conflict and Hamas took action against it."
"Well, the meaning of the conflict until now is really the basis of Israel's greed"
"smells weird smells real, liberals talk about the Palestinian conflict Israel wants to defend Israel but plays around like crazy so you don't know"
"The Palestine vs Israel conflict is very sad and we are grateful that all the children of this nation are in a frenzy, much different from the poor peasants who killed their heads in a corner of the country."
"each party builds a narrative that hates conflict has become a commodity for our elites, don't sprinkle the fire of conflict with gasoline, hate, mas, that's my point, it's fair and proportional."
"The book doesn't deal with current political issues, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict deals with international law, not territorial claims based on biblical verses or clear predictions about the Day of Judgment or the religion of Rohman."
"hello, the conflict between israel and palestine is internal, brothers and sisters, and the homeland is still sad because it's poso, why is it that i stay silent, i just save poso"
There are still many Palestinian-Israeli conflicts and many are asking which United Nations is interested in such stories and how the world works.
"The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a nationalism and nation conflict, not a religion, not a religion"
"Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we must sympathize with the Palestinian people, but we must also know that the leader of Hamas"
"All those who feel that they are Palestinians must join because rockets and bullets can't vote, that's why this is not a religious conflict but not all Jews are pro Israel http"
"This has nothing to do with orders, but many Indonesian people are pro-Palestinian because Palestine is an Islamic country, they have been in conflict for thousands of years."
"I think that now moderate Islamic groups have changed their perspective on the israel-Palestinian conflict ending with more frequent gin negotiations, which are now also becoming weapons clashes that appeared at the beginning."
The Israel-Palestine Conflict is a politically and economically important conflict with major countries in the region

They are trying to direct public opinion that Palestine and Israel are not a religious issue but only a political issue
Indonesia as a citizen of the world and adheres to free and active politics must also initiate efforts for a just peaceful solution to the israel-Palestinian conflict in the Solidberg struggle
It's stupid that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a religious conflict

"Hamas and Israel From the perspective of Hamas is the hero of the Palestinians, Hamas is like a terrorist, but from another perspective that Hamas and Israel are one stronghold, where Hamas becomes a force to expel Palestinians by small attacks that respond with big attacks."
it's not okay for people to support the evil of the israel war just because they have different opinions and are blind to the Palestinian victims
